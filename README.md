# Anime Search App 🎌

A lightweight Single Page Application (SPA) that lets users search for anime
titles, browse results, and “like” their favorites — all without page reloads!

## ✨ Features
- **Live Search**: Query the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) for anime data
- **Dynamic Cards**: See poster, score, and episode count for each title
- **Like Button**: Toggle favorites locally (client‑side state for now)
- **Responsive Layout**: Flex‑grid adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 🚀 Getting Started
